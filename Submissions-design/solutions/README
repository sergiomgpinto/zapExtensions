SOLUTIONS FOLDER

This folder is for storing documents relating to delivered user stories, such as 
design documents, test reports, documentation, etc...
Design documents will help your team reaching a shared understanding about the
design of your implementation and are also an important tool for communicating with 
your team's designated teaching assistant. Feel free to use whatever tool is most
convenient to you.  This might be Visual Paradigm, but can just as well be pictures 
of a whiteboard or a drawing on paper. (As long as it's readable!)

In this folder, please create subfolders named

user_story_xx

where xx is the number of the user story, e.g. '01'.
